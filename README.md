# MEMORY-GAME
I have created a math-themed memory game in Python to boost math skills in Mexican students for better PISA test results.

## Description
I have developed a memory game in Python with a mathematical operations theme, designed for players to compete against the computer. This project was created with the specific goal of improving the mathematical performance of children taking the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) test in Mexico. In recent years, the PISA test results in Mexico have shown a significant decline in mathematical proficiency among students.

The game aims to help enhance the mathematical agility and problem-solving skills of children, which are essential for success in the PISA test and in real-world math-related challenges. By providing an engaging and interactive learning experience, the game encourages students to practice and improve their math skills in a fun and enjoyable way.

The game's mathematical operations theme not only makes learning more enjoyable but also reinforces essential math concepts and problem-solving techniques. It is designed to be an educational tool that complements traditional classroom instruction and helps students build confidence in their mathematical abilities.

The project's ultimate objective is to contribute to the academic success of students by offering an interactive and entertaining way to practice and enhance their math skills, ultimately leading to improved performance in the PISA test and beyond.
